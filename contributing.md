ActiveRabbit Contribution Guide
===============================
In general I do not have much time personally to work on ActiveRabbit.
I will do my best to quickly review any pull requests. Any issues or bugs
filed without a PR will probably take some time for me personally to work on.

## Contribute
To contribute:

* Open a PR
* Must write tests for your change
* Tests must pass
* I will merge it

## Become a Core Contributor!
Want to approve others' PRs or merge your own PRs without my approval?
Open an issue and I'll seriously consider it!
